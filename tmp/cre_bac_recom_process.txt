CRE_BAC_RECOM

Currently this process is modelled much like the int_recom process, it has a input well, cassette and backbone.

In reality the process in the lab is more complex and we should be modelling more data.

When we create the cre_bac_recom plate / well we do not know the orientation of the backbone ( unlike normal int recom process )

We could / should model a intermediate step in LIMS2 that creates a two 'plates' with the backbones in both
formard and reverse orientations.

When QC is done then we will know what orientation the backbone is and can create the proper cre_bac plate.

For now we just put the backbone is, so it may not reflect the real syn vec.
