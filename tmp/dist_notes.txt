Workflow:
Changes for next release are commited into master branch
new tag is made in github
tag is downloaded into fresh directory and dzil build is run
tarbal is placed somewhere sensible so it can be built in vm


dzil build - build tarball to release


[PruneCruft] - prunes files people normally put in skip file ( MANIFEST.SKIP )
[Licence] - generate licenes file
[Readme] - generate readme file

#cpan stock tests - are we doing this?
perl-critic.t
pod-coverage.t
pod-syntax.t

instead of these use:
[ExtraTests]
[Test::Perl::Critic]
[PodCoverageTest]
[PodSyntaxTest]

Can replace above with:
[@Basic]
[PodSyntaxTest]
[PodCoverageTest]
[CriticTest]

[AutoPrereqs] - analyze code to to find all libraries we need - 
need to specify specific version in use statements

Git
[Git::Check] - check working copy in clean state before allowing release
 - allow_dirty = dist.ini
[Git::Commit] - commit

HTGT bundle uses:
*[AllFiles] - same as Gatherdir - looks in root directory and adds all files there
[HTGTVersion] - CUSTOM - gets HTGT_BUILD_VERSION from env
[CompileTests] - DEPRECATED to Test::Compile - common tests to check syntax of module
[PackageNameTests] - CUSTOM check package name matches file name of modules
*[ExtraTests] - author / release / smoke tests
[InstallDirs] - mark dir contents for installation ( bin and share )
*[ExecDir] - installs bin/ files as executables
*[License] - make licence file
*[MakeMaker] - make Makefile.PL
*[Manifest] - build Manifest file
*[ManifestSkip] - does not build files in MANIFEST.SKIP file
*[MetaYAML] - makes META.yml file
[PkgVersion] - add version to each package
[PodWeaver] - makes pod better
*[PruneCruft] - prune surplus files that end up in working dir
*[Readme] - build readme file

[@Basic]
[GatherDir] - gather all files in root directory
[PruneCruft]
[ManifestSkip]
[MetaYAML]
[Licence]
[Readme]
[ExtraTests]
[ExecDir]
[ShareDir] - installs a directories contents as ShareDir content ( default dir = share )
[MakeMaker]
[Manifest]
[TestRelease] - extract archive and run tests before releasing dist
[ConfirmRelease] - asks for user confirmation before releasing dist to cpan
[UploadtoCPAN] - upload dist to CPAN when using release command


FileGatheres - collect files for distribution
FilePruners - remove some of these files
FileMungers - change file contents

# below is htgt dist ini stuff

bundle = @HTGT
remove = MakeMaker
remove = MetaYAML
remove = PodVersion
