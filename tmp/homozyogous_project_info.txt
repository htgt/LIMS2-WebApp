Double Targetted Products, targetting both alleles.

The final product will be:
First Allele: Conditional Knockout, targetted area is just flanked by loxp scars ( we have applied flp to remove reporter region )
Second Allele: Deletion, the targetted area has been deleted.

Why?
So we can study thinks in-vitro ( cells ) as apposed to in-vivo work that is done currently.
Currently need to breed the mice to get the right strain. ( because only one allele is targetted at a time ).
We can't do this for work on humans, clearly must just work with cells so we need to make double targetted products ( for both alleles ).

Modelling:
So we can have first allele or second allele final vectors ( currently same plate / process type but this could change ).
    No clear link between the first allele and second allele final vectors ( they could in theory be different designs ).
    In practice the plates names will be clear ( First Allele plate, second allele plate ), and the wells will correspond ( e.g A01 on both plates are linked ).
        However we do not model this link
    Difference between first and second allele final vector is second allele has cre applied to it. ( deletion )

Proposed we have 2 types of EP, one for first allele one for second allele. ( make it easier to report if done this way ).
First Allele if just applying flp to it ( to remove reporter region, just leave loxp scars )
The second allele EP has 2 inputs, first allele ep and the second allele final vector.

Questions?
What data is expected for each process?
What data is attached to each well?
Does the well data for the first EP and second EP differ? ( the processes will be different )
Is the process to create the first allele just flp_application onto the EP?
Second electroporation process, are input wells the XEP and FINAL ( second allele ) wells?
Whats the difference between a clone_pool and clone_pick?
